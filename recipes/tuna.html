    <h1>Seared Ahi Tuna</h1>
    <img src="tuna.jpg" alt="seared tuna">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Let's get one thing straight, this ain't canned tuna! You have 
       to buy this at your grocery store, along with a few other 
       ingredients. It's simple to make, and your friends will think
       you're a badass cook, and they'll make you cook at every 
       gathering. And that's okay, granted that they do the dishes!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>T
       <li>Two 5 oz Ahi Tuna Steaks</li> 
       <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
       <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
       <li>1/2 tablespoon butter</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
       <li>1 tablespoon whole peppercorns</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <l>Pat the tuna steaks dry and season both sides with salt 
            and cayenne pepper.
        </l>
        <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat</li>
        <li>Add olive oil & peppercorns. Cook until the peppercorns
            soften & pop, which is around 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Gently place seasoned tuna in the skillet and cook until
            you're satisfied with it's doneness. This is all on personal
            preference, but the more medium-rare the steak, the better!
        </li>
        <li>Slice the tuna however many pieces you like, but I'm not 
            going to share!</li>
    </ol>
