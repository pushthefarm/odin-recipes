    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tired of blowing your hard earned money on banana bread at
        Starbucks? If you're a penny pincher like me, but love that
        sweet bread, you might want to continue reading. No barista
        expertise needed here, just an ounce of your attention span
        and a few ingredients.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups flour: This gives the bread structure.</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda: Acts as a leavener, which makes the bread
            rise
        </li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt: Just a pinch would enchance the flavor.</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter: Makes it more rich, moist, and irresistable</li>
        <li>3/4 cup brown sugar: To make it sweet.</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten: Acts as a binding agent, to hold the batter together</li>
        <li>2 1/3 cups mashed overripe bananas.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Farenheit. Lightly grease a 
            9x5-inch loaf pan
        </li>
        <li>
            Grab two separate bowls. In the first bowl, combine the flour,
            baking soda, and salt. In the second bowl, beat the butter and
            brown sugar until smooth and then add the eggs and mashed bananas.
            Stir the mixture in the second bowl until it's well blended. Stir
            the mixture into the first bowl and stir the combination until its 
            just combined. Pour the batter into the prepped loaf pan.
        </li>
        <li>Let bake for around 60 minutes. To test, insert a toothpick into
            the bread, and it should come out clean. If not, let it bake a 
            bit more. When finished, let the bread cool for 10 minutes, and then
            Let it cool completely on a wire rack.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Ready to start saving that $4 that you spend on every slice of that
        banana bread at Starbucks? Give it a try.
