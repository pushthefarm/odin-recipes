This is a sample project that I am following along with from the Odin Project.

Working with Git is a bit of a pain at first but I'm sure it'll get better. I had to push something so I can switch the branch to main. Then I pushed the rest of my code. 
I acknowledge that even dog turd looks more appealing than this sample site.
